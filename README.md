# Computer Vision Nuffield Project
This project contains code from a Nuffield Placement at the Glasgow Caledonian University in 2013. During that time, I completed two projects - CAMSHIFT, a colour based tracking system, and a Non-Photorealistic Rendering application - both making use of the excellent OpenCV.

## Report & Poster
During the placement, I produced the following report and poster on the project:
